A clone of Micrograd built by me for learning about the internal working of neural nets while following Andrej Karpathy's educational content.

### Micrograd
A tiny Autograd engine. Implements backpropagation (reverse-mode autodiff) over a dynamically built DAG and a small neural networks library on top of it with a PyTorch-like API. Original repo:- https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd
